    <h1>About Mike</h1>
    <p><strong>Driven by purpose. Grounded in experience. Focused on impact.</strong></p>

    <p>My career spans over 30 years in IT — but I didn’t just work in tech. I lived it. I’ve helped small businesses stay afloat through crisis, secured networks before “cybersecurity” was a buzzword, and supported users through challenges both technical and human. I’ve worked lean, led from the front, and showed up even when the system didn’t.</p>

    <p>I specialize in cybersecurity operations, incident response, and infrastructure hardening — all with a strong focus on protecting people, not just endpoints. My approach is simple: understand the risk, communicate with clarity, and take action with integrity.</p>

    <p>In my current role as a Systems Engineer for a Managed Service Provider, I help clients secure complex environments while balancing performance, budgets, and real-world constraints. I’ve implemented endpoint protection strategies, improved backup resilience, supported Microsoft and cloud infrastructure, and worked directly with executives to help them understand their risks and their options.</p>

    <p>I’m also the creator of <strong>#MindfulMikeSecurity</strong>, <strong>Cyber Breakfast for Businesses</strong>, and <strong>The Mindful CISO</strong> — content series designed to make cybersecurity more human, more accessible, and more aligned with leadership. These aren’t just posts; they’re part of my mission to help bridge the gap between technical teams and business decision-makers. Because security isn’t just a product — it’s a mindset.</p>

    <p>As I complete my B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and work toward certifications like the SSCP, CCSP, and CISSP, I remain focused on long-term goals: to become a Chief Information Security Officer who leads with wisdom, empathy, and execution. Not just a seat at the table — but a voice that guides it.</p>

    <p>Whether it’s building systems, responding to threats, mentoring new talent, or helping leadership see the road ahead, I believe security is about trust — and I’ve spent a lifetime earning it.</p>
